CSS style element

<style>
.red-text{
color:red;
}
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">blabla</h2>

Font element
h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

You can set an element's font by using the font-family property.

For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to Sans-serif, you would use the following CSS:

h2 {
  font-family: Sans-serif;
}

Specify How Fonts Should Degrade
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These include Monospace, Serif and Sans-Serif

When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but also degrade to the Sans-Serif font when Helvetica wasn't available, you could use this CSS style:

p {
  font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif;
}
Now comment out your call to Google Fonts, so that the Lobster font isn't available. Notice how it degrades to the Monospace font.

Add Images to your Website
You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.

An example of this would be:

<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">

Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing.
